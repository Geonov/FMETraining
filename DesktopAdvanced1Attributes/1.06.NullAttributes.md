# Null Attributes #

Null attributes are a very important part of FME’s attribute handling. Not every dataset has null values, and not every format supports them; but when they do exist it is important for FME to handle them correctly.

## What is a Null Value? ##

In general, a null attribute value is the equivalent of **nothing**. However, it’s important to be precise in our terminology because there are many ways to represent nothing:

- An attribute has a particular *state* that indicates nothingness (null)
- An attribute has a particular *value* that indicates nothingness (for example, -999)
- An attribute exists but has no value (empty)
- An attribute doesn’t exist (missing)
- A numeric attribute is NaN (Not a Number)
- A numeric attribute has a value of zero

In fact, Safe Software’s developers identified fifteen (15) different ways for “nothing” to be represented in spatial and tabular data.

So when we talk about *null*, it has a particular meaning. For us, null is a specific state that is deliberately set to signify that the information does not exist. It tells us that the lack of information is not a mistake, as a missing or empty value might be.

Because there are so many different methods, this section will discuss ways to handle "nothing" attribute values, but with a particular emphasis on Null values.


## How does FME Represent Nothing? ##
FME’s internal engine has its own state to represent null. However, when presented to the user, a null value is usually represented as &lt;null&gt;.

For example, this feature in the Logger has &lt;null&gt; for the ParkName attribute:

![](./Images/Img1.019.NullsInLog.png)

Similarly, the FME Data Inspector will depict nulls as &lt;null&gt;:

![](./Images/Img1.020.NullsInDI.png)

Notice how we have a wide range of "nothing" values here. The ParkName is a true &lt;null&gt;, the RefParkId has a value of -9999, and Washrooms is &lt;missing&gt; (meaning the attribute doesn't exist).

<strong>&lt;missing&gt;</strong> is an interesting concept. You might be asking, "how do we know when an attribute is missing"? But a better question is "how do we know that the attribute should exist"?
<br><br>We know it should exist because it appears in the schema defined in a reader. For example, in the above screenshot, Washrooms appears in the schema, but for some reason certain features do not have that attribute. That makes the attribute &lt;missing&gt;.
