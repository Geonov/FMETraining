## Testing Isolated Sections ##
Testing and debugging a large workspace is easier when it's possible to isolate sections and test them separately. 

The ability to isolate specific sections is done by disabling connections. This renders a connection inoperative in much the same way as if it had been deleted, and no features will pass through.

A connection is disabled by right-clicking it and choosing the option to Disable (or selecting it and using the shortcut Ctrl+E):

Disabled connections are listed in the Navigator window:

Here the user has chosen to disable connections so that they can test the first PointOnAreaOverlayer transformer without the second one running as well:

This speeds up the translation so that testing of the required section runs quicker.

An alternative to testing isolated sections is to run a workspace with the run option Run with Full Inspection turned on.
<br><br>However, be aware that:
<ul><li>Such an approach will take up more time and system resources</li>
<li>You will need to disable all Writers to avoid writing data</li>
<li>SQL and Python transformers may contain statements that will still change data (this is something you should be careful of anyway)</li></ul>

Of course, it's much easier to disable certain parts of a workspace when you've properly divided it up into sections with bookmarks. Anyway, here's a question for you:
<br><br>It's possible to disable other objects besides connections. Can you pick out which of these objects (there may be more than one) can be disabled in Workbench?
