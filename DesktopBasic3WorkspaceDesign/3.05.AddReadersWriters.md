# Multiple Readers and Writers #

 readers and writers can be added to a workspace at any time, any number of formats can be used, and there does not need to be an equal number of readers and writers.

Additionally data can be read from 

For example, the Navigator window shows this workspace contains 50+ readers (and writers) of all data types and formats!
