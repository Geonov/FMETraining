## Transformer Gallery ##
The transformer gallery is the obvious place to start looking for transformers. There are a number of ways in which transformers here can be located.

## Transformer Categories ##
Transformer categories are a good starting point from which to explore the transformer list. Transformers are grouped in categories to help find a transformer relevant to the problem at hand.

All transformers were recategorized for 2017. Some long-existing categories were dropped and some new ones created. Altogether, the chosen categories are a better reflection of what a transformer affects, are less ambiguous that previous categories, and are better synchronized with categories in other FME resources such as the Knowledge Centre.

Important categories include:

- **Attributes**: Operations that return a calculated value
- **Calculated Values**: Operations that return a calculated value
- **Filters and Joins**: Operations for dividing and merging data flows
- **Geometries**: Operations that create geometry or transformer to a different geometry type
- **Spatial Analyses**: Operations that return the result of a spatial analysis
- **Strings**: Operations that manipulate string contents, including dates 

Simply click on the expand button to show all transformers within a particular category.

## Transformer Help ##
The FME Workbench Help tool displays information about transformers. Simply click on a transformer and press the F1 key to open the help dialog.

This tool is linked to FME Workbench so that a transformer selected (in the gallery or on the canvas) triggers content to display in the Help tool.
