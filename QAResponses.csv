Chapter^Question^Answer^Result
1^1^1^FME is certainly out-of-this-world, but no, this ETL does not mean Extra-Terrestrial Lifeform. Try again please!
1^1^2^Yes, you got it right! FME is a type of Extract,Transform, Load tool. Well done. You have proved you are listening to the instructor!
1^1^3^Sorry. ETL does not mean Express Toll Lane. FME is certainly 'express', but there should be no toll for using it. Try again.
1^1^4^Eat, Transform, Love. It changed my life. But it's not the correct answer here. Go back and try again.

1^2^1^Sentient? You might imagine that FME can think for itself, but that's not the right answer. 
1^2^2^No, FME does not have a retro-encabulator. Nor does it have sinosoidal depleneration. Nice try, but it's not the right answer.
1^2^3^Yes, at the core FME has a very rich data model that powers all of the translations and transformations.
1^2^4^Ten points from Gryffindor for sarcasm. FME does not have a core of unicorn hairs, or any dragon body parts. Try again.

1^3^1^FME Workbench is definitely part of FME Desktop. We're looking for the wrong answer and this is not it, so try again.
1^3^2^It's not a tool you'll commonly use, but the FME Integration Console is definitely part of FME Desktop. We're looking for the wrong answer and this is not it, so try again.
1^3^3^Correct! The FME Server Console is a part of FME Server, not FME Desktop.
1^3^4^The FME Data Inspector is definitely part of FME Desktop. We're looking for the wrong answer and this is not it, so try again.

1^4^1^Yes, FME Workbench has an advanced graphic interface for defining flows of data graphically. Well done.
1^4^2^Do you know what I'm thinking now? No? That proves neither you nor FME are telepathic. Try again.
1^4^3^No. FME is many things, but it should never be problematic. Try again.
1^4^4^No, no, no! FME is expressly designed to avoid writing lots and lots of code, in C++, Java, Fortran, or anything. Try again.

1^5^1^There is an arithmetic editor dialog, but there is not a specific "math(s) window" in FME. Try again.
1^5^2^In a general sense all windows in a Spatial ETL are geography windows. In a more practical sense, none of them are. Try again.
1^5^3^Is this an English Literature window I see before me? No. Try thou again.
1^5^4^Yes, there is a history window. It's very useful for reverting to a previous state (ie undoing multiple changes at once). Well done.

1^6^1^FME Workbench allows you can stack one window on top of each other. We're looking for the wrong answer and this is not it, so try again.
1^6^2^FME Workbench allows windows to 'float' anywhere on your desktop. We're looking for the wrong answer and this is not it, so try again.
1^6^3^No. FME windows don't need to be insulated. So this is the correct answer. Well done.
1^6^4^FME Workbench allows you can tab windows next to each other. We're looking for the wrong answer and this is not it, so try again.

1^7^1^Because then the Explorer dialog only displays files whose extension matches the format type. Well thought out if you got this correct.

1^8^1^No, you can definitely set the data format by typing it in. Try again.
1^8^2^No, you can definitely set the data format from a drop-down list. Try again.
1^8^3^No, you can definitely set the data format by browsing in the formats gallery. Try again.
1^8^4^No, selecting the file will set the data format (though be careful because some extensions are the same for different formats). Try again.
1^8^5^Correct. Like most multiple-choice questions of this type, the answer is "none of the above". They are all valid ways to set the data format. Well done.

1^9^1^Nope. F4 is close, but not correct. Try again.
1^9^2^Correct. You'll get so used to this shortcut you'll probably wear the symbol off your keyboard! 
1^9^3^No. F5.6 is not correct, not even for raster data formats. Try again.
1^9^4^No. F# is a guitar chord that is particularly difficult to form. If FME were a chord it would be G or Em. Reprise this question and pick a better answer.

1^10^1^No. Color and linestyle are a part of the feature, not the schema of a dataset. Try again.
1^10^2^The number of features is important, but it's not really part of the schema/data model. Try again.
1^10^3^You've got it. Layers (or whatever you call them) are a key component of a dataset's schema. Well done.
1^10^4^I suppose this is the classic GIS query, but it's not what we're looking for and you know it. Try again and pick a proper answer this time!

1^11^1^The Table View window does have a sort option,either alphabetical or numeric,so your answer is wrong. Try again.
1^11^2^Incorrect. Right-click does have an option to inspect that feature in the Feature Info window. Try again.
1^11^3^OK. You got me. There is a Copy option. But there is no Cut or Paste, so this is the correct answer.
1^11^4^Wrong. It is possible to save the selected data to a new format. It's a very useful capability. Try again.

2^1^1^Shapefile to Geodatabase is a very common translation. But it's not the most common. Try again.
2^1^2^Shapefile to AutoCAD, putting GIS data into a CAD system,is very common. But not the most common translation. Try again.
2^1^3^Google Earth is a format you think would be used very often. It is, but it's not the most often used. Try again.
2^1^4^Yes! Shapefile to Shapefile is the most common translation in all of FME. It proves people use FME for data transformation and not just format translation.

2^2^1^Yes, parameters that have been checked are blue, parameters needing checking are yellow, and unset parameters are red. Well done!
2^2^2^No! Green is not a color you see on a parameter button. Try again.
2^2^3^No! Green is not a color you see on a parameter button. Try again.
2^2^4^No! Green is not a color you see on a parameter button. Try again.

2^3^1^Loops in a polygon boundary are not attributes, they are geometry. Try again and think harder next time!
2^3^2^Loops are geometry, but this is not a transformation of the data structure (data model). Try again.
2^3^3^Loops in a polygon boundary are not attributes, they are geometry. Try again and think harder next time!
2^3^4^Correct! Loops are geometry and cleaning them is a transformation of their content. Well done.

2^4^1^No. The StringFormatter does not rely on the strings of one feature to affect another. It is feature-based. Try again.
2^4^2^Yes. The Clipper is group-based. It needs the clip boundary features so that it can clip the clippee features. Well done.
2^4^3^No. The Rotator works on one feature at a time. Each feature is rotated in turn, not as a group. It is feature-based. Try again.
2^4^4^No. The AttributeRounder can round features independently of each other. It is feature-based. Try again.

3^1^1^Incorrect. You can create a bookmark by using the Insert Bookmark button on the toolbar. Try again.
3^1^2^Correct. You can create a bookmark by selecting multiple transformers, but not just a single transformer. Well done. That's a very subtle difference
3^1^3^Incorrect. You can right-click existing transformers and choose Create Bookmark. Try again.
3^1^4^Incorrect. You can create a bookmark by using the Ctrl+B shortcut. Try again.

3^2^1^Header annotation is what appears at the top of a newly created canvas. Try again.
3^2^2^Parameter annotation... does not exist. Well done, that's the correct answer.
3^2^3^User annotation is what you add to the canvas manually. Try again.
3^2^4^Summary annotation is an annotation of transformer parameters and feature type schemas. Try again.

3^3^1^Correct. Transformers can be disabled in Workbench. Can you find the other correct answers?
3^3^2^Correct. Feature Types can be disabled in Workbench. Can you find the other correct answers?
3^3^3^No. You can't disable annotation. That's because it doesn't do anything at run time. Try again.
3^3^4^Well... technically you can't disable a bookmark. But you can choose to disable all the objects within it. So you're sort of correct!

3^4^1^Correct. You can open a template in FME Workbench using File > Open
3^4^2^Correct. You can open a template in FME Workbench using File > Open Recent Template
3^4^3^Correct. You can open a template by double-clicking it in a file browser like Windows Explorer
3^4^4^Correct. You can open a template in FME Workbench using the Getting Started part of the start tab

4^1^1^Oracle Spatial: Table
4^1^2^MicroStation Design: Level
4^1^3^Esri Geodatabase: Feature Class
4^1^4^Adobe PDF: Layer

4^2^1^Source filename changes: Source dataset parameter
4^2^2^Attribute type changes in database: Update feature type
4^2^3^Additional database table needs reading: Import feature type
4^2^4^New file dataset needs reading: Add Reader (technically you could use an existing reader of the same format - but usually you'd create a new reader)

4^3^1^No! You shouldn't have to create two workspaces here. One is enough. Besides this wouldn't even work. Try again.
4^3^2^No! You shouldn't have to create two workspaces here. One is enough. Besides this technique is pure nonsense. Try again.
4^3^3^No. This technique would actually work, but it's not very efficient. You shouldn't need to add PostGIS readers. Try again.
4^3^4^Yes! This is the simplest technique. This works because you can import a schema from any dataset, even one of a different format. Well done.

5^1^1^Sorry. Databases is a category of transformers. Try again.
5^1^2^Correct! Formats is not a category of transformers. The Stylers category is the closest to this, with transformers relating to different formats.
5^1^3^Sorry. Linear Referencing is a category of transformers. Try again.
5^1^4^Sorry. Surfaces is a category of transformers. Try again.

5^2^1^Chopper: Manipulators. Also, did you know that "Lumberjack" is a transformer alias. It's not for the Chopper though...
5^2^2^Terminator: Infrastructure. If you place more than one of these transformers you get Terminator, Terminator 2, Terminator 3, etc!
5^2^3^Matcher:Filters. Think of the Matcher as a dating site for spatial features! It's a filter because it filters out incompatible features.
5^2^4^DateFormatter: Calculators. There are three uses of the word date: a fruit, a day on the calendar, and a social activity. Guess which this is!

5^3^1^Correct. Because this is the string editor the value returned will be literally "2+2". To evaluate this arithmetically, use the arithmetic editor.
5^3^2^Incorrect. The result of "2+2" is not 4 - try again.
5^3^3^Incorrect. The result of "2+2" is not 4.0 - try again.
5^3^4^Incorrect. This won't result in an error. FME will process it and return an actual value.

5^4^1^Correct. Three transformers in the Filter category appear in the top 25: The Tester (1st), TestFilter (11th), and GeometryFilter (15th).
5^4^2^Wrong. There are not four Filter transformers in the top 25. Try again.
5^4^3^Wrong. There are not five Filter transformers in the top 25. Try again.
5^4^4^Wrong. There are not six Filter transformers in the top 25. Try again.

5^5^1^Use the Tester because we need to test for one value as a simple Yes/No. The AttributeFilter is better for multiple values, and doesn't do a "Begins With" either.

5^6^1^Incorrect. We can't say for certain that eight features will appear from the merged port. They may, or may not.
5^6^2^Incorrect. We can say for certain that however many features emerge, it won't be eighteen. Suppliers don't emerge from the Merged port.
5^6^3^Incorrect. Very incorrect. We can say for certain that however many features emerge, it won't be 26. The output will not be Requestors plus Suppliers.
5^6^4^Correct. Well done. The features will all be Requestors, so there could be 8, but maybe fewer depending on how many matches there are. We can't tell.

5^7^1^We change the TitleCase data to UPPERCASE (rather than the reverse) because uppercase is easier to match. Converting to TitleCase can be risky depending on the attribute contents.
