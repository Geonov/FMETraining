# Module Review

This chapter investigated Custom Transformers and how they can be used to improve your FME workspaces

**What You Should Have Learned from this Module**

The following are key points to be learned from this session: 

**Theory**

- A custom transformer is a sequence of standard FME transformers, condensed into a single unit.
- A custom transformer lets you tidy your workspace, re-use sequences of transformers, and apply advanced functionality.
- Handling parameters in a custom transformer is very important, and can be done either automatically or manually.
- Custom transformer instances point to a definition that is either *embedded* or *linked*.
- Custom transformers are used to implement *parallel processing*.
- Custom transformers are used to implement *loops*.

**FME Skills**

- The ability to create, edit and reuse a custom transformer.
- The ability to handle parameters in a custom transformer.
- The ability to export a custom transformer definition.
- The ability to switch types from embedded to linked (or vice versa).
- The ability to use parallel processing.
- The ability to use loops.
