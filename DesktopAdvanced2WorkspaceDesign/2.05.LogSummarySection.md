## Translation Summary ##

The final part of a log file includes a report of the number of features read and written:

More importantly, from a performance point of view, it includes a brief report of the time taken by the translation and the amount of memory used:

<pre>
Translation was SUCCESSFUL with 0 warning(s) (308 feature(s) output)
FME Session Duration: 1.1 seconds. (CPU: 0.8s user, 0.3s system)
END - ProcessID: 3984, peak process memory usage: 105448 kB, current process memory usage: 93964 kB
Translation was SUCCESSFUL
</pre>

Peak memory usage is an important statistic. It signifies how hard FME is having to work. If this number can be reduced, performance will often improve.

### Written Features ###

One of the most misinterpreted statistics in an FME log is the number of features written.

What this really means is “the number of features sent to the writer”. It doesn’t always mean the same number of features actually gets written to the output dataset, or that the output dataset will contain only that number of features.

For example, a feature sent to a writer might be rejected because of invalid geometry. In that case the log reports the feature written, but an earlier warning might note:

<pre>
Rejected 1 output feature
</pre>

Similarly, a format may have geometry limitations that cause the output dataset to be slightly different to the numbers logged.

For example, MicroStation DGN format has a limit on vertex numbers for each element (feature). If the MicroStation writer receives a feature with too many vertices, it splits that feature into multiple MicroStation features (*elements* in MicroStation speak) to avoid going over the vertex limit.

Thus, the number of features that actually appear in the dataset can be different to the number of features logged as being sent to the writer!

Currently, features read or written by the FeatureReader/FeatureWriter transformers are not included in the summary at the end of the log. To find this information you would need to examine the feature counts displayed on the connections in or out of those transformers.
<br><br>Similarly, Features Read does not include features that were read from a cached source dataset.
