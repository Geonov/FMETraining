# Module Review

This chapter looked at FME Performance and some of the techniques available to improve it

## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session: 

### Theory ###

- Analyzing a log file helps to determine where performance improvements can be made
- Performance is the measure of useful work done in a given time. Excess data and caching to disk are two factors that impact performance
- Reading performance is improved by reducing the amount of data being read
- Writing performance is improved by ordering the FME Writers correctly
- Transformation performance is improved by removing excess attributes and properly managing group-based transformers
- Database performance is improved by passing tasks to the database and setting reader/writer parameters correctly
- FME Server and FME Cloud process large quantities of data in a scalable environment
- Batch processing is a way to make use of the full processing power of a given computer

### FME Skills ###

- The ability to analyze and deconstruct an FME log file
- The ability to measure workspace performance for each set of components
- The ability to use various methods for optimizing reader, writer, and transformer performance
- The ability to use database parameters to improve performance
- The ability to batch process data with the WorkspaceRunner transformer
