## Improving Transformation Performance ##

In most cases, slow, memory-consuming translations are caused by group-based transformers.

Remember that in feature-based transformation a transformer performs an operation on a feature-by-feature basis where a single feature at a time is processed. Such a transformation only takes as much memory as is necessary to store a single feature.

However, a group-based transformer performs an operation on a group or collection of features and it takes as much memory as is necessary to store all features of the group!

It is this grouping of data that causes performance degradation.

You’ll get better performance when you put the least amount of data into a group-based transformer as possible.
For example, put feature-based filter transformers BEFORE the group-based process, not after it (see following exercise). Another technique is to make group-based transformers more feature-based...

### Making Group-based Transformers more Feature-based ###

Obviously, when a group-based transformer is needed, then it must be used. However, many group-based transformers have a parameter that, in effect, makes them more feature-based.

One common parameter is called "Input Ordered" and appears near the Group By parameter in most transformer dialogs:

![](./Images/Img2.029.TransformerPerformanceGroupedFeatureParam.png)

The condition for applying these is that the groups of features are pre-sorted into their groups. When this is the case, and I can set this parameter to By Group, then FME is able to process the data more efficiently. 

For example, in the above screenshot, the user is using postal code as a group-by parameter (i.e. each address looks for it's nearest neighbor *in the same postcode*). If the incoming data is already sorted in order of postcode then the user can set the Input Ordered parameter and allow FME to treat this more like a feature-based transformer.

Besides the "Input Ordered" parameter, some transformers have their own, unique, parameters for performance improvements.

For example, the NeighborFinder transformer expects two sets of data: Bases and Candidates. By default, FME caches all incoming Bases and Candidates because it needs to be sure it has ALL of the candidates before it can process any bases.

But, if FME knows the candidate features will arrive first (i.e. the first Base feature signifies the end of the Candidates) then it doesn’t need to cache Base features. It can process them immediately because it knows there are no more candidates that it could match against.

The user specifies that this is true using the parameter Candidates First:

![](./Images/Img2.030.TransformerPerformanceNeighborsFirst.png)

Look at this log file for a workspace that uses a NeighborFinder. By default it looks like this:

<pre>
Translation was SUCCESSFUL with 0 warning(s) (13597 feature(s) output)
FME Session Duration: 29.6 seconds. (CPU: 27.7s user, 1.5s system)
END - ProcessID: 28540, peak process memory usage: 231756 kb
</pre>

With Candidates First turned on it looks like this:

<pre>
Translation was SUCCESSFUL with 0 warning(s) (13597 feature(s) output)
FME Session Duration: 28.4 seconds. (CPU: 27.4s user, 0.8s system)
END - ProcessID: 26429, peak process memory usage: 178412 kb
</pre>

It’s about 5% faster than before, but more importantly, it’s used nearly 25% less memory!

But how does a user ensure the Candidate features arrive first? Well, like writers you can change the order of readers in the Navigator, so that the reader at the top of the list is read first.

It doesn’t improve performance *per se*, but it does let you apply performance-improving parameters like the above.

### Attributes and Transformation ###

As mentioned (in Reader Performance) reducing data helps performance because it saves FME from either holding it in memory or caching it to a disk.

However, this isn’t just helped by reducing the number of features; it is also helped by reducing the size of each individual feature.

One aspect of this is attributes. Carrying attributes through a translation impacts performance, so if the attributes are not required in the output, it’s best to remove them *as early as possible* in the translation.

For example, the incoming schema looks like this:

![](./Images/Img2.033.TransformerPerformanceAttrsSourceSchema.png)

But the outgoing schema looks like this:

![](./Images/Img2.034.TransformerPerformanceAttrsDestSchema.png)

Since so many of the source attributes are not required in the output, it makes sense to remove them from the translation, and as early as possible. There are two ways to do this. Some reader formats (but not all) have a setting in the reader feature type to avoid reading excess attributes:

![](./Images/Img2.035.TransformerPerformanceReadAttrs.png)

With that, you can ensure that only attributes exposed are read. The other way to remove attributes is by using a transformer (AttributeManager, AttributeRemover, or AttributeKeeper) directly after the source feature type:

![](./Images/Img2.036.TransformerPerformanceRemovingAttrs.png)

This ensures that none of the extra attributes become a drain on resources by being processed by any further transformers.

#### Lists ####

One specific type of attribute to beware of is a *List*. A list in FME is an attribute that can have multiple values. Because of this, it can be a big drain on resources.

For example, use a Joiner to join a feature to 1,000 records and the list for that feature will have 1,000 sets of records. This is bad enough, but if the list is exploded and all of the original attributes kept, then there will be 1,000 features each with 1,000 sets of attributes!

In general, beware of creating lists unnecessarily and of keeping them in a workspace beyond the point at which they are still of use.

---

### Geometry and Transformation ###

Like attributes, geometry can be removed from a feature, in this case using the GeometryRemover transformer.

Many FME users create translations that handle tabular – non-spatial – data. If you are reading a spatial dataset, then writing it to a tabular format, be sure to remove the geometry early in the workspace, just as you would an attribute.

Another particular problem is carrying around spatial data as attributes. Spatial database formats - for example, Oracle or GeoMedia - usually store geometry within a field in the database; for example GEOM. When FME reads the data it converts the GEOM field into FME geometry and drops the field from the data.

However, if you read a geometry table with a non-geometry reader, the translation could end up with the geometry stored as an FME attribute. A similar thing could happen when a workspace reads only one geometry column of a multiple geometry table.

Geometry will create *very* large and complex attributes, which take up a lot of resources. If you don’t need them, then it’s worth removing them.

Basically, you should only carry through the translation any geometry and attributes you need for the output of your workspace. If the data is not required, then it can and should be removed as early in the workspace as possible.
