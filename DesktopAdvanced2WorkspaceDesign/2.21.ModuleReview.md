# Module Review

This chapter looked at FME Performance and some of the techniques available to improve it

## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session: 

### Theory ###

- Feature Caching enables inspection of the data at any point in the translation
- Bookmarks are good for planning a workspace and can be used to increase performance when caching features
- Partial runs allow you to run sections of workspaces without running the entire thing.
- Analyzing a log file helps to determine where performance improvements can be made
- Performance is the measure of useful work done in a given time. Excess data and caching of data to disk are two factors that can impact performance greatly
- Improve reading performance by reducing the amount of data being read
- Improve writing performance by ordering the FME Writers correctly
- Improve transformation performance by removing excess attributes and properly managing group-based transformers
- Upload larger tasks to multiple engines on FME Server 
- Make use of all reader/writer parameters to improve database performance
- Employ parallel processing to make FME multi-threaded
- Use batch processing to use multiple FME engines with multiple datasets

### FME Skills ###

- The ability to design a workspace before starting
- The ability to analyze and deconstruct an FME log file
- The ability to remove no data from rasters
- An understanding of potential methods for improving reader, writer, and transformer performance
- The ability to use database parameters to improve performance
- The ability to apply parallel processing in an FME workspace
