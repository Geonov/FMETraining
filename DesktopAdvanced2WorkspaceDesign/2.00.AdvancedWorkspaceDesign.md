# Advanced Workspace Design #

Workspace design is a key factor in optimizing performance. We already know that a badly designed workspace has consequences for Best Practice, making it harder to maintain and scale. However, such a workspace also performs worse too. This becomes increasingly true as an author tackles more complex projects and constructs larger and more intricate workspaces. Even a sub-second delay per feature can be significant, when millions of records are being processing. 

So this chapter covers how to design a workspace to optimize performance. These techniques can be used for new workspaces, or to update existing workspaces. However, to assess performance requires a way of measuring it, and this is obtained by interpreting a translation log file.

Hi, in this chapter I'll help power up your workspaces, and improve their performance through advanced design and optimization techniques. The first thing we'll do is deconstruct a log file, so that we understand what it means.
