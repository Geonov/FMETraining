# Bookmarks 

Bookmarks play an important role in a well-styled workspace for a number of reasons, including these:
- Design: As a way to subdivide a workspace and manage those sections
- Access: As a marker for quick access to a certain section of the workspace
- Editing: As a means to move groups of transformers at a time
- Performance: As a means to improve workspace performance when caching data


### Performance and Bookmarks ###

When using Feature Caching, performance takes a big hit, especially when working with large workspaces. Caching all of the data can be prevented by using bookmarks. When a bookmark is collapsed and the workspace is run, only the output feature is cached:

This means that data is cached only for the final transformer in the bookmark, saving considerable time and resources. 


### Deleting Bookmarks ###

When a bookmark is collapsed it will delete all of its contents along with it. This is useful for removing entire sections of your workspace.
