# Batch Processing #

Batch processing is the execution of a series of workspaces in FME or the processing of multiple files at one time.

## Batch Processing Using the WorkspaceRunner ##

The WorkspaceRunner is a transformer that will run another FME workspace when it is used in a translation. When it is used in conjunction with the Directory and File Pathname reader it can be used for batch processing. 

For example, we have a workspace that reads in orthophotos and neighborhood boundaries that merges the orthophotos into one image and then clips it to the neighborhood boundaries, removes the black borders created by the clip and then writes back out to GeoTiff by neighborhood name:

Each week we get new orthophotos and instead of changing the data in the previous workspace, we can create a workspace to batch process all the new files, this also allows FME to start multiple processes so the data will be processed faster:

To setup, the WorkspaceRunner, set the FME Workspace to the workspace you are looking to batch process. Then set the Source File to path_windows which is created by the Directory and File Pathnames Reader:

If you have a job that needs to be completed before the next one runs, there is an option to Wait for Jobs to Complete. This will ensure a job is completed before starting another one. Setting this option will prevent multiple Concurrent FME Processes. 

If the jobs can be completed in any order, you can set the Maximum Number of Concurrent FME Processes, up to 7. This will start multiple FME processes which can be seen in the Details tab of the Windows Task Manager:

## Batch Processing Using the Batch Deploy Wizard ##

Batch deploy is available under the Run menu in FME Workbench. It supports both instant batch execution and the creation of batch files. This allows you to process a large number of source datasets in the current workspace and produce a separate output for each:

Batch deploy operates in the form of a Wizard. The user specifies the input and output datasets plus any other relevant settings such as a suffix for the output file names. 

If the process is not executed right away, a batch .tcl file is created containing the batch process settings, as well as a .bat file which is used to start the process at a later date. 

Using the same workspace as above in the Create Batch Translation Wizard, setting the Source Type to the GeoTiff Reader:

![](./Images/Img2.068.BatchDeployDataType.png) 

Then select your Source Data. You can select all of the data you want to be batch processed manually or you can use a &ast; wildcard, which will find all of the files ending in .tif:

![](./Images/Img2.069.BatchDeployDataSource.png) 

You can select a different file destination as well as change the dataset basename if desired:

Finally, you can choose to run this batch deploy now or save the scripts so you can run the workspace outside of Workbench:

If you chose to run the workspace now, clicking finish in the wizard will run the workspace immediately. If you saved the scripts, you can browse to them and run the workspace at any time.

Batch Processing can also be done using the command line or a FME Command File. These techniques are more advanced then we want to get into for this course, but if you are interested in learning more you can check out the Knowledge Base Article <a href="https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/1384/fme-batch-processing-methods-1.html" alt="Batch Processing Article">FME Batch Processing Methods</a>
