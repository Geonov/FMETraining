## Bookmarks ##

A bookmark, like its real-world namesake, is a means of putting a marker down for easy access.

With FME the bookmark covers an area of workspace that is usually carrying out a specific task, so a user can pick it out of a larger set of transformers and move to it with relative ease.

### Why use Bookmarks? ###
Bookmarks play an important role in a well-styled workspace for a number of reasons, including these.
- Design: As a way to subdivide a workspace and manage those sections
- Access: As a marker for quick access to a certain section of workspace
- Editing: As a means to move groups of transformers at a time
- Performance: As a means to improve workspace performance when caching data

### Bookmarks and Feature Caching ###

When Feature Caching is enabled it slows down the performance of the workspace because the features are cached at every transformer. When working with a larger workspace this leads to a lot of data being cached, sometimes unnecessarily:

Notice how in the above screenshot that every transformer in the ___ bookmark is being cached.

However, when a bookmark is collapsed, then caching only occurs on the bookmark output objects:

This means that the data is cached only for the final transformer in the bookmark, saving considerable time a resources.
