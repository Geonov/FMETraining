# FME Desktop Training Manuals #

This repository contains the manuals for FME Desktop and FME Server training.

Notice that each different manual is held in a different branch, and only periodically merged into the master branch. Therefore do not use the master branch as the source for training content (it may not be up to date) or to push updates to (the manuals are not built from the master branch).
