# 64-Bit FME

64-bit FME is not for everyone, but used in the right place it can have tremendous benefits.


## What is 64-bit FME? ##

A 32-bit operating system is capable of using memory addresses up to 2<sup>32</sup>. This limits them to using a maximum of 4 gigabytes of system memory. 

A 64-bit operating system can use memory addresses up to 2<sup>64</sup>. This allows them to use a theoretical maximum of 16 billion gigabytes of memory! In practice, a 64-bit system uses nowhere near that much memory, but it still allows 64-bit software to access a much greater amount of additional memory than 32-bit.

64-bit FME is a version of FME specifically designed to take advantage of a 64-bit operating system. It is well-suited to processing very large amounts of data, due to its ability to use a greater amount of memory.

## What are the Disadvantages of 64-bit? ##

There are a number of disadvantages to using 64-bit FME.

### Operating System ###
64-bit FME requires a 64-bit operating system and the hardware to support it. On a 32-bit operating system you would only be able to run 32-bit FME.

### Format Limitations ###
Not every format in FME is supported on 64-bit. Usually that’s because the format itself – or its proprietary software – isn’t available on 64-bit platforms. In that situation you would need to use 32-bit FME.

### 64-bit Clients ###
Not a limitation, but 64-bit does require care in selecting the correct database clients; for example when reading 64-bit Oracle you’ll need to install a special 64-bit client for FME to be able to connect.
