Included here are a number of workspaces generated by your colleagues. As the resident FME expert you have been asked to assess the performance of each workspace.

**1)** Start Workbench 

Start Workbench and open the workspaces in turn.

Assess each workspace for its ability to employ parallel processing. You should answer the following questions for each workspace.

- Do any transformers permit parallel processing?
- Is there an existing group I can parallel process by?
- Is there an artificial group I can create to parallel process by?
- Will parallel processing speed up the workspace performance, or make it worse?

The answers to these questions can be found in the finished workspaces.
