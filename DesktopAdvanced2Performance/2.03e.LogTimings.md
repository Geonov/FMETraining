**Log Timings**

One interesting thing is that the cumulative time reported by a translation is the amount of time the FME process was actually translating or transforming data. It doesn’t include the amount of time spent waiting for other processes to do their work.

For example, take this section of  log timings:

2014-07-10 14:43:06| 8.5| 0.0|
2014-07-10 14:43:13| 8.8| 0.3|
2014-07-10 14:46:29| 18.0| 9.1|
2014-07-10 14:49:29| 25.8| 7.9|

The difference between the start absolute time (14:43) and the finish absolute time (14:49) is over six minutes. However, FME is only reporting 25.8 seconds of processing time!

The “lost” time is down to external processes that FME was waiting on.

For example, when a query is issued to a database, the time taken to respond with the results is not included in the FME processing time. The more a query is not well-formed or a database is not well-structured, the longer this time difference will be.

Similarly, the amount of time taken to read/write data from/to a disk is not included in this number.

Look at the section on Database Efficiency for more information on performance tuning FME for databases.
