You have just been assigned to a project to calculate the "walkability" of each address in the city of Vancouver. Walkability is a measure of how easy it is to access local facilities on foot. It will include a measure of the distance to the nearest park, the amount of crime in an area, and other similar metrics.

, but they moved onto another project and handed you their workspace. The workspace currently assesses crime, parks, and noise-control areas, but it doesn't give an overall measure of walkability.

So let's do that, and then see if there are any other aspects we can include.

---

<br>**1) Start FME Workbench**
<br>Start FME Workbench.

Notice that the workspace file they gave you is a template (it has the file extension .fmwt). That is good because it means that there might be existing feature caches for the project. Ensure that Enable Feature Caching is turned on and open the workspace template from C:\FMEData2019\Workspaces\DesktopBasic\BestPractice-Ex1-Begin.fmwt.

This workspace is a bit messy, but we will fix that in a later exercise: 

![](./Images/Img5.200.Ex1.WorkspaceOverview.png)


<br>**2) Add an ExpressionEvaluator Transformer**
<br>We can create a measure of walkability that combines all of our current values using the ExpressionEvaluator transformer.

So add an ExpressionEvaluator transformer to the end of the workspace _(AttributeValueMapper&#95;2)_.

Inspect its parameters. Set it up to create a new attribute called Walkability that is:

<pre>
ParkDistance + CrimeValue - NoiseZoneScore
</pre>

![](./Images/Img5.201.Ex1.ExpressionEvaluatorDialog.png)

With this expression, the smaller the result, the better. Run the workspace, since the template file had all the feature caches saved, only the ExpressionEvaluator will run.


<br>**3) Assess the Result**
<br>Let's assess whether the result of the translation is correct.

Firstly check the log window for errors and warnings. There are no errors, but there are several warnings, which is not a good sign.

![](./Images/Img5.202.Ex1.TranslationLogWarnings.png)

Click on the warnings button to filter out the warnings. The warnings say:

<pre>
ExpressionEvaluator: Failed to evaluate expression '@real64(560.3272250455418+&lt;null&gt;-0)'.
Result is set to null
</pre>

Inspect the output cache on the ExpressionEvaluator, and some addresses do indeed have a Walkability value of &lt;null&gt;.

So we know there is a problem, let's try and figure out where the problem is and why it occurs.


<br>**4) Locate the Problem**
<br>We can tell the warning comes from the ExpressionEvaluator, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is where the problem lies. The calculation fails because the middle value is &lt;null&gt;. If the expression is:

<pre>
ParkDistance + CrimeValue - NoiseZoneScore
</pre>

Then we know that it must be the CrimeValue that is an issue. Organize the workspace a bit, and then inspect the caches on the FeatureJoiner transformer:

![](./Images/Img5.203.Ex1.FeatureJoinerOutputs.png)

We know that some features from here are getting a &lt;null&gt; result. So now check the cache for the AttributeValueMapper. That's where values are set, so perhaps nulls are coming out of there?

<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
A useful test would be to right-click on CrimeValue in the Table View window, and sort by ascending numeric order. That will put any null values to the top of the table.
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

On inspection, there are no &lt;null&gt; values for the CrimeValue attribute in there. There are also no nulls for the Aggregator and CenterPointReplacer caches.

Now let's check the feature counts on each connection. There are 9,899 features tagged with a crime (FeatureJoiner:Joined), and 3,698 that are not (FeatureJoiner:UnjoinedLeft). That gives a total of 13,597, which is correct.

Oh. Do you see it yet? The 3,698 features that are not tagged with a crime: what CrimeValue do they get? Inspect the UnjoinedLeft output from the FeatureJoiner, and you will see that they do not have a value. That's why the ExpressionEvaluator says that there are nulls.

To confirm this I copied the log into a text editor and searched for the phrase "ExpressionEvaluator: Failed to evaluate expression".
<br>It appeared 3,698 times, the same as the number of features that exit the UnjoinedLeft port. Coincidence?
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

<br>**5) Fix the Problem**
<br>If those features do not have a CrimeValue attribute, then we should give them one. To do so add an AttributeCreator transformer to the workspace:

![](./Images/Img5.204.Ex1.AttributeCreatorOnCanvas.png)

Open up its parameters and create an attribute called CrimeValue with a value of zero (0).

![](./Images/Img5.205.Ex1.AttributeCreatorParams.png)

Run the workspace, which will run from the AttributeCreator to the ExpressionEvaluator. You should now find that there are way fewer warnings and that the output contains no &lt;null&gt; values.

<br>**6) Add Swimming Pools**
<br>The city has decided that parks are not a great candidate for walkability scores because there is usually a park nearby. They decided to evaluate how easy it is to walk to a swimming pool, and this evaluation might be used to decide later where a new pool should be built.

We can reuse the same workflow for swimming pools that was built for parks, with just a few minor updates.

First let's add a new reader with the following parameters:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">OpenStreetMap (OSM) XML</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2019\Data\OpenStreetMap\leisure.osm</td>
</tr>

</table>

When prompted, select only the leisure feature type:

![](./Images/Img5.206.Ex1.LeisureFeatureType.png)

Then move the new leisure reader near the Parks reader and connect it to the NeighborFinder:Candidate input port. Then right-click on the Parks reader and select disable.


<br>**7) Filter Leisure Data**
<br>If you inspect the leisure data, you'll notice that there are various types of leisure facility, the type being recorded in the *leisure* attribute.

So, add a Tester transformer between the leisure reader and the NeighborFinder. Set up the parameters to test for leisure = swimming_pool

![](./Images/Img5.207.Ex1.SwimmingPoolTester.png)

<br>**8) Update Transformer Parameters**
<br>Now update AttributeRenamer to be PoolDistance instead of ParkDistance. The renaming of this attribute will cause the ExpressionEvaluator to turn red.

To fix the ExpressionEvaluator, open the parameters and change @Value(ParkDistance) to @Value(PoolDistance) to take account of the new PoolDistance attribute:

<pre>
@Value(PoolDistance) + @Value(CrimeValue) - @Value(NoiseZoneScore)
</pre>

Re-run the workspace. Check the log for warnings and errors, and then inspect the ExpressionEvaluator cache.

Notice that the walkability scores are exceedingly large all of a sudden, due to the PoolDistance. Something is wrong, but what?


<br>**9) Locate Problem**
<br>The PoolDistance is the source of the problem. There is no related log message to give a clue, and the Feature Count numbers look correct.

Let's inspect the data, click on the leisure reader and while holding the <kbd>shift</kbd> key, click on the NeighborFinder. Then right-click on either object and select Inspect Cached Features, this will open all the selected caches in Visual Preview.

Visual Preview shows two specks of data, a long distance apart. This result is typical of a mismatch of coordinate systems.

Click on some features and select the Feature Information button, in this window you will see that the main data has a coordinate system of UTM83-10, while the leisure data from OSM has a coordinate system of LL84.

This disparity is why the "nearest" pool to each address is such a high distance.


<br>**10) Fix Coordinate System Problem**
<br>The obvious solution is to reproject the pools to the correct coordinate system. So, add a Reprojector transformer to reproject the leisure data before it gets to the NeighborFinder:

![](./Images/Img5.208.Ex1.ReprojectorOnCanvas.png)

Inspect its parameters and set it up to reproject from LL84 to UTM83-10

Re-run the appropriate parts of the workspace. Check the log window and inspect the ExpressionEvaluator cache.

Each address now has a walkability score, with a lower number being better and a higher number worse.
