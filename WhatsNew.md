# What's New #
This file documents major changes made to training materials in 2016

## Desktop Basic ##
These changes are for the FME Desktop Basic Training Course.

### Data Translation Basics ###
- Split the "More Data Inspector Functionality" section into two parts
- Added information on 2016.1 updates to Data Inspector styling

### Data Transformation ###
- Transformer Ports: replaced Counter with 2DForcer as an example of single input/output port (as Counter got a rejected port in 2016.1)
- Made note of other transformers with new rejected ports in 2016.1

### Best Practice ###
- The data used for the "I love bridges" debugging exercise has been cleaned up so that it is in the correct position
- Includes a new exercise called "Design Patterns"
- Removed the way-too-simple exercise on templates
- Made note of transformers with new rejected ports in 2016.1
- Updated bookmark sections with new 2016.1 functionality
- Added information on output port reordering in 2016.1
- Added information on the new Junction transformer in 2016.1
- Added information on the ability to hide connections in 2016.1

### Translation Components ###
- All previous exercises have been replaced by new ones centred around a fundraising walk scenario. These use a new GPS trail dataset
- Made note of new design of Geodatabase (ArcObjects) parameters dialog in 2016.1

### Practical Transformer Use ###
- The wrapping-up exercise (HTML property report) has been dropped and the prior exercise (data joins with crime data) promoted to take its place
- The Attribute section has been restructured on a task-basis, rather than transformer-by-transformer. That structure better accommodates the new AttributeManager transformer 
- Noted Help window no longer automatically updates in 2016.1
- Noted difference between Tester Regex operations in 2016.0 and 2016.1
- Made note of transformers with new rejected ports in 2016.1

### General ###
- Exercises are now numbered 1,2,3,etc within their particular chapter. A name (rather than number) denotes the chapter. This is because chapter numbers do not match the numbers GitBook assigns
- Improved (I hope) exercise descriptions and scenarios
- There are many more Q+A questions, all of which have the answers as the final section of their particular chapter
- Removed the update date from the course introduction page, as it cannot be easily kept up-to-date
- Changed text/screenshot to reflect renaming from Community Answers to Q&A Forum
