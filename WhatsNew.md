This file documents major changes made to training materials in 2016

### Data Translation Basics ###


### Data Transformation ###


### Best Practice ###
- The data used for the "I love bridges" debugging exercise has been cleaned up so that it is in the correct position
- Includes a new exercise called "Design Patterns"
- Removed the way-too-simple exercise on templates

### Translation Components ###
- All previous exercises have been replaced by new ones centred around a fundraising walk scenario. These use a new GPS trail dataset

### Practical Transformer Use ###
- The wrapping-up exercise (HTML property report) has been dropped and the prior exercise (data joins with crime data) promoted to take its place
- The Attribute section has been restructured on a task-basis, rather than transformer-by-transformer. That structure better accommodates the new AttributeManager transformer 

### General ###
- Exercises are now numbered 1,2,3,etc within their particular chapter. A name (rather than number) denotes the chapter. This is because chapter numbers do not match the numbers GitBook assigns
- Improved (I hope) exercise descriptions and scenarios
- There are many more Q+A questions, all of which have the answers as the final section of their particular chapter
