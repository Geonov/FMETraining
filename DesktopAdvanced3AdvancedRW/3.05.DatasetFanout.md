## Dataset Fanout ##

A Dataset Fanout delivers data to the same feature type, but in multiple datasets. Using the elevation example again, here the output is a different dataset for each elevation value:

The result of this fanout is a series of DXF datasets, each of which has one elevation’s worth of contours on one layer.


### Setting a Dataset Fanout ###

A Dataset Fanout is defined in the Navigator window in Workbench, just below the writer’s dataset parameter:

Double-clicking the Fanout Dataset parameter opens a dialog in which a Fanout checkbox is set. Here you can define the folder to write to and the Fanout Expression to use. The default values set the Fanout Directory from the destination dataset path, and the Fanout Expression from the destination dataset file name:

To achieve a fanout (a different file per attribute value) select an attribute to include in the file name, such as this:

![](./Images/Img3.021.DatasetFanoutDialogSet.png)

In this case, each different neighborhood produces a separate file of park features. 

It's important to note that the Text Editor dialog can be used to add different components to both the Fanout Directory and the Fanout Expression, including user parameters, functions, and datetimes. Generally, even if the requirement is to use an attribute to define a sub-folder, it would go into the Fanout Expression, rather than the Fanout Directory.

  <question multiple>
    <p>
      Q) Fanouts are an important part of writing data with FME, so tell me, which of these statements are true? Pick as many of these answers as you think are correct:
    </p>
    <answer correct>You can have both a Feature Type Fanout and a Dataset Fanout in the same workspace</answer>
    <answer correct>You can use a Feature Type Fanout with a database format, but not a Dataset Fanout</answer>
    <answer>A fanout expression can be an attribute, or a constructed string, but not a user parameter</answer>
    <answer>A fanout cannot be based on a format attribute such as fme_color</answer>
    <br><br><explanation>A) It's true you can have both types of fanout in the same workspace, although a database writer won't do a Dataset Fanout (it can create multiple tables, but not multiple databases). A Fanout Expression can be any attribute (including FME attribute or format attribute) or string, and it can be a user parameter too!</explanation>
