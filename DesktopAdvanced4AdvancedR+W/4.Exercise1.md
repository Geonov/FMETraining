You’ve been given a dataset of development zones and asked to separate each zone type into a separate Shape file and send it back with everything zipped together in a single file.

The requestor thinks this will be a difficult task; but with FME you should be able to do it in about two minutes.

**1)** Inspect Source Data

The source data for this translation is a MapInfo TAB dataset:
C:\FMEData2015\Data\Zoning\Zones.tab

Inspect the source dataset in the Data Inspector. Notice that there is a field called ZoneName.
We need the first characters of this field (up to any “–“ character) for our fanout.

**2)** Start Workbench

Start Workbench and generate a workspace to translate the MapInfo source data to Esri Shape.

By default the workspace will include a GeometryFilter and multiple output feature types.
However, we know the data is polygon only (because we inspected it first, right?) so we can remove much of this.

So, delete the GeometryFilter transformer and all of the Writer feature types except Zones_ polygon. You’ll end up with something that looks like this:

**3)** Add StringReplacer Transformer

To remove everything after the “-“ character in the ZoneName field, place a StringReplacer transformer into the workspace, between the Reader and Writer feature types.

**4)** Set Parameters

Open the parameters dialog for the StringReplacer.

For the Attributes field, select ZoneName.

For the Text to Match enter: -(.+)$

Leave the Replacement Text field empty.

Select Use Regular Expressions = Yes (this is very important)

This regular expression will search out the dash character – and anything after it – and replace it with nothing (i.e. delete it). Click OK to close the dialog.

**5)** Set Fanout

Open the Feature Type Properties dialog for the Writer feature type. Set the Fanout by Attribute checkbox on and select ZoneName as the attribute to fan out by:

Click OK to close the dialog.

**6) **Save and Run Workspace

Save the workspace. Run the workspace using File > Prompt and Run.

When prompted manually change the Destination Directory to:
C:\FMEData2015\Output\Zones.zip.

Open the output folder in a file browser.

You should see the file Zones.zip. If you open it up there will be inside a Shape file for every zone type.
