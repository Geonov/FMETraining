## Dynamic Attributes ##




### Adding or Deleting Attributes ###

Even in a dynamic translation, sometimes you need to add or delete attributes from the output schema. This is very simple to do.


#### Adding a New Attribute ####

Adding a new attribute to all output on a dynamic feature type is just a case of editing the feature type definition to add that attribute.

In other words, any attribute you add to the feature type definition will get added to all features output through there – regardless of source or resource schemas.

For example, I might add an attribute if an AreaCalculator transformer was in the workspace and I wished to store the result.

#### Deleting an Attribute ####

Deleting an existing attribute is done through the dynamic Schema Definition dialog. At the foot of that dialog is a field for removing attributes:

The edit […] button opens a dialog in which to select attributes that are in the source schema but that you don’t want in the output. You can choose to select these existing attributes – or type in an entirely different value, if you know an attribute exists but is not exposed.
