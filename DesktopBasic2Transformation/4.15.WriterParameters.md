## Controlling Writers ##
Writers are controlled with **writer parameters**.

Because parameters refer to specific components and characteristics of the related format, writers of different formats have a different set of control parameters.


### Writer Parameters ###
Writer parameters can be located - and set - in one of two locations.

Firstly, these parameters can be found in a dialog when a new workspace is being generated, or a new writer added:

Secondly, after the workspace is generated/writer is added, parameters are shown and set in the Navigator Window.

For ease-of-use, basic parameters are listed first, followed by advanced.

Writer parameters only exist in the Navigator window. They don't appear in the Parameter Editor dialog because there are no writer objects on the canvas to click on.

To edit a parameter, double-click it. A dialog opens up where the parameterâ€™s value may be set.
