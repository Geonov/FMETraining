# Module Review

This chapter looked at User Parameters and some of the more advanced techniques involved in their use.

## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session:

### Theory

- FME is used by both workspace authors and end-users. In general, authors make use of **FME Parameters**; end-users make use of **User Parameters**.
- User parameters accept user input that can be used within a workspace
- User parameters can be linked to FME parameters as an indirect form of control
- Many types of user parameters exist to allow the user to enter different types of information in a controlled way
- Parameters can be shared to reuse their content in multiple places
- Parameters can be embedded or scripted to construct complex values from simple input
- Parameters can be made to accept fixed values, attribute values, or both


### FME Skills

- The ability to use FME parameters and to create user parameters
- The ability to extract information from user parameters and/or link user parameters to FME parameters
- The ability to use complex parameter types such as Choice with Alias, or Attribute Name.
- The ability to use shared, embedded, and private parameters
- The ability to accept fixed values only, or attribute values only
