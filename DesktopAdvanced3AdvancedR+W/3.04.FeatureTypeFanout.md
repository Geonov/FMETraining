## Feature Type Fanout ##

A Feature Type Fanout delivers data to multiple feature types (layers) within a single dataset. Taking the elevation example, here the output is a different feature type for each elevation value:

This results in a DXF dataset containing multiple layers of data.

### Setting a Feature Type Fanout ###

A feature type fanout is defined in the Feature Type parameters by selecting an attribute for the feature type name, like so:

The Feature Type Name then changes to match what has been selected:

In this case, each feature with a different park name will be written to a different layer of the GML output dataset.
