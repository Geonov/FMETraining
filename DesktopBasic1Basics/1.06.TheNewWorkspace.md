## The New Workspace ##
A new workspace reads from left to right, from the source (Reader) layers, through to the destination (Writer) layers. Arrows denote the direction of data flow:

In the above screenshot, eight layers are being read from one format and written to another.

{% import "../includes/templates.html" as template %}

{% call template.tip() %}

In most cases FME uses the terms 'Reader' and 'Writer' instead of 'Source’ and ‘Destination.' So a Reader reads datasets and a Writer writes datasets, in terms analogous to source/destination and input/output.

## Saving the Workspace ##
Workspaces can be saved to a file so that they can be reused at a later date. The save button on the toolbar is one way to do this:

There are also menu options to do the same thing, in this case, File &gt; Save (shortcut = Ctrl+S) or File &gt; Save As. The default file extension is .fmw.

{% call template.lizard() %}

There are several intuitive, but less obvious, features of the FME Workbench interface.
<br><br>For example, select File &gt; Open Recent on the menubar to reveal a list of previously used workspaces. This list can show up to a huge 15 entries.
