In the previous exercise we inspected some data from a translation and added a second dataset. Now we can rearrange the data to make the display clearer.


<br>**1) Start FME Data Inspector**
<br>Continue in the FME Data Inspector from the previous exercise. You should have both the converted zones data (as GeoJSON) and a dataset of neighborhood boundaries in KML. The Display Control window looks like this:

![](./Images/Img1.214.Ex4.DisplayControlWindow.png)


<br>**2) Set Neighborhoods Symbology**
<br>The Display Control window shows a number of different layers in the VancouverNeighborhoods dataset. In reality most of these are tabular (non-spatial) items. The layer we are really interested in is called Neighborhoods.

Click the symbology icon for the Neighborhoods data in the Display Control window:

![](./Images/Img1.215.Ex4.SetSymbologyIcon.png)

Set the color to be a neutral shade (like orange) and increase the opacity value to 0.8:

![](./Images/Img1.216.Ex4.SetSymbologyDialog.png)


<br>**3) Set Draw Order**
<br>The previous change makes it clear that the zone features are below the neighborhoods in the drawing order. To solve this problem drag the Zones dataset above the VancouverNeighborhoods dataset in the Display Control Window.

At the same time set a color for the zones data fill color and reduce the opacity value to 0.1. The main view will now look like this:

![](./Images/Img1.217.Ex4.ResymbolizedData.png)

If you query a zone feature you'll see that it has both a ZoneCategory and ZoneName attribute. You might not realize, but there is a relationship between those attributes. Each ZoneName belongs to a specific ZoneCategory, where Category:Name is a 1:Many relationship.

Let's clarify the display by merging all the features into one feature per ZoneCategory. We can do that in FME Workbench.
 

<br>**4) Return to Workspace**
<br>Return to FME Workbench. Open the workspace saved in Exercise 2, or the workspace listed above. 

What we'll do here is use what we call a transformer. This is something we'll cover in more detail in the chapter on Data Transformation. Basically it is an object to transform data in some way.

Click on the dark line connecting the Reader Feature Type and Writer Feature Type. Start typing the word "Dissolver":

![](./Images/Img1.218.Ex4.AddTransformer.png)

When you see the Dissolver transformer appear in the list, double-click on it to place it into the workspace. The result will look like this:

![](./Images/Img1.219.Ex4.DissolverTransformer.png)

The Dissolver parameter will merge together all features with a common attribute value.


<br>**5) Set Dissolver Parameters**
<br>Click on the little cogwheel icon on the Dissolver transformer (it will probably be yellow in color):

![](./Images/Img1.220.Ex4.DissolverParametersButton.png)

This will open a parameters dialog for the transformer. Click the elipsis (...) button next to the Group By parameter. In the dialog that opens select the ZoneCategory attribute and click OK.

![](./Images/Img1.221.Ex4.DissolverGroupByParameter.png)

Click OK again to close the parameters dialog. 

Save the workspace and run it once more. The translation will run and the data be overwritten.


<br>**6) Refresh Data Inspector View**
<br>Back in the Data Inspector, rather than reopening the data, let's refresh the view of it. To do so click the Refresh button on the toolbar:

![](./Images/Img1.222.Ex4.DIRefreshView.png)

You'll now find there are fewer features, as many have been merged together.


<br>**7) Set Background**
<br>When inspecting data it will help to have a background map to provide a sense of location. The FME Data Inspector is capable of displaying a backdrop from several different mapping services.

Select Tools > FME Options from the menubar. In the Background Map section, select a background map format. If you have an account with a specific provider, please feel free to use that. Otherwise select Stamen Maps:

![](./Images/Img1.223.Ex4.BackgroundMapDialog.png)

Click the Parameters button. A map constraint (type) dialog will open. Click the browse button and select "terrain":

![](./Images/Img1.224.Ex4.BackgroundMapPropertiesDialog.png)

Click OK and OK again to close these dialogs. A background map is added to the display. Notice that the data is reprojected to match the coordinate system of the chosen background. For example, the Stamen Maps background causes the data to reproject to Spherical Mercator, with a clear change of shape:

Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC-BY-SA</a>.





<br>**6) Filter Data**
<br>The parks data is opaque too (you may optionally change this to be more transparent) but more importantly we cannot tell which parks are dog parks.

Click on the tab marked Parks in the Table View window or, if the tab does not exist, select Parks from the drop-down list of tables.

Notice that there are many parks in the city, but that there is also a DogPark attribute to tell us which parks have a dog run area. Click on the DogPark name to sort the table data by that attribute.

![](./Images/Img1.64.Ex3.TableViewDogParks.png)

Now we know which are dog parks, clicking on a feature will highlight it on the display window. However, it would be easier to find dog parks if we could filter the data. Therefore choose Tools > Filter Features from the menubar.

In the Filter Features dialog, double click in the Left Value field, click the drop down arrow, and select Attribute Value. Choose DogPark as the attribute to filter by and click OK.

For the Operator field select the = (equals) symbol, if it is not already selected.

For the Right Value field, click in the field and type the character Y (it should be upper case, not lower).

![](./Images/Img1.65.Ex3.DogParkFilter.png)

Filtering in the Data Inspector is applied to all visible data (if you clicked OK now the Neighborhood data would also be filtered out) therefore we must also add a clause to enable the neighborhood data to remain on screen.

Create a second test clause using the same techniques as before. This time test for where NeighborhoodID > (is greater than) 0 (zero)

![](./Images/Img1.66.Ex3.NeighborhoodIDFilter.png)

The Pass Criteria parameter should be set (or left as) "One Test (OR)."

![](./Images/Img1.67.Ex3.DIFilterCriteria.png)

Now click OK to close the dialog. The display will be filtered to show only the neighborhood features plus parks with a dog run facility.

![](./Images/Img1.68.Ex3.FilteredData.png)
<br><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:x-small">Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC-BY-3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC-BY-SA</a>.

The Display Control Window will also show the effects of the filter:

![](./Images/Img1.69.Ex3.DisplayControlFilter.png)




<br>**8) Filter Data**
<br>Initially no data will appear on screen because we already have a filter set that will exclude it.

So, again select Tools > Filter Features from the menubar.
This time set up a test to filter where Rescue = Y (i.e. Fire Halls which are also a rescue facility).

![](./Images/Img1.71.Ex3.EmergencyFilter.png)

At this point you should be able to suggest to the mayor a neighborhood that has both a dog park and an emergency rescue facility. Click on the neighborhood feature to find out which it is.
